# 🍋 LittleLemonCapstone Project 🍋

Welcome to the LittleLemonCapstone project! This project is part of my Professional Certificate in Back-End Development by META. The main objective of this project is to create a web application using Python, Django, and Django REST framework.

## 📚 Project Overview

The LittleLemonCapstone project focuses on building a restaurant web application with the following features:

- **Menu API**: Allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on menu items.
- **Booking API**: Manages table bookings for the restaurant.
- **Token Authentication**: Implements secure authentication using Djoser for token generation and validation.
- **Testing**: Ensures the robustness of the application through comprehensive testing.

## 🔧 Endpoints to Test

Here are the endpoints you can use to test the application:

1. **Menu API**
   - Retrieve all menu items: `/restaurant/menu`
   - Retrieve a specific menu item by ID: `/restaurant/menu/3`

2. **Booking API**
   - Manage table bookings: `/restaurant/booking/table`

3. **Token Authentication**
   - Generate tokens for authentication: `/restaurant/token`
